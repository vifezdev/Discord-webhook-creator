# Discord webhook site
Create your own webhook site using this base

# Description
This is a simplified version of the website [Discohook]([https://test.com](https://discohook.org/), I have developed this incase anybody would like to create their
own version of that website using this base or just to mess around with the tool!

# How to use
I developed this in the simplest way I possibly could so that all users can use the code

Steps:

- Pull the code or download
- Open the code in a text editor (recommend using [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Edit the website to your liking
- Once you have editted it, Open the index.html and test the webhook system!
